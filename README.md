# Inko, the flashcard app

For now, this is a dev test model, the firebase configuration is not set as a deployment model yet, to run this on your own, you have to configure a firebase server based on the data models at hand.

This project will be updated to be easier to deploy on any device.

To install and use Inko, clone the repository, run `npm install`, and start building the client.
